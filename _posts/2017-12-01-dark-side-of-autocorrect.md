title: "The Dark Side of Autocorrect"

We awaited artificial intelligence for decades. As we anticipated the great arrival of the robotic butlers, AI quietly reached into every domain from shopping to driving, and it’s spreading tirelessly. Technology advances at an inhuman pace. Unless we anticipate the challenges of AI, we will realize them only in hindsight.

One of the AIs we must reckon with is autocorrect. Only a bit younger than computer science itself, it mediates everything typed on a smartphone. It’s a powerful entity with side effects that deserve further study.

It started as squiggly red lines under our spelling mistakes. After a user finishes typing, they can use a spell checker to compare the document’s words to a dictionary, fixing typos and common misspellings like “alot,” “miniscule,” and “strait-laced.”

Though spell check has been a core feature of word processors since the ‘70s, its breakthrough came with the smartphone. To make the exceedingly difficult task of typing on a touchscreen easier, smartphone keyboards use a language model to figure out what a user actually means to press as they mash the keys. The iPhone, for example, invisibly enlarges keys one is likely to press next so they are harder to miss. Spelling is automatically checked in the process. This combination of spell checking and input assistance is autocorrect.

Spell check is constrained to word processors and thus largely formal contexts. Autocorrect, on the other hand, mediates all text input, whether one is typing a document or a text message. Because spell checking enforces Standard English, informal speech runs against autocorrect’s grain. While Standard English may be preferable in documents, this is not necessarily the case for informal contexts. If one wants to curse or actually prefers the spelling “miniscule,” they have to fight with autocorrect.

Because there are many ways to spell most English sounds, English spelling has a tendency to drift. By enforcing Standard English in spaces where novel spellings would have previously gone unmolested, autocorrect alters the evolution of English.

Autocorrect’s models do get updated, but because people adapt quickly to change or can even anticipate it, a human-edited dictionary like Merriam-Webster actually accepts some words that autocorrect doesn’t, such as “abridgement.” That said, autocorrect is growing friendlier to informal speech. As of 2017, one can finally type “fuck” on a phone.

Autocorrect, a seemingly innocuous AI that is often the butt of jokes, has significant leverage over a property as fundamental as spelling. But it now mediates something far more impactful than that.


In 2014, years after the release of the iPhone and despite autocorrect, typing on a touchscreen remained slow. Maybe the solution required the disruption for which tech is so well-known. “Typing as you know it might soon be a thing of the past,” Apple promised when it released QuickType, an evolution of autocorrect that analyzes the sentence being written and suggests the next word. Writing a short phrase like “on my way” requires typing only “on.” To write the rest of the phrase, one needs only click the large suggestion buttons for “my” and then “way.”

QuickType is capable even in complex phrases. However, because it’s limited to three choices, QuickType is unlikely to suggest the perfect word one would have used otherwise. It hardly needs to be said that words are  important. They convey not only meaning, but mood, personality, bias. The uncountable qualities of language defy quantification. If QuickType homogenizes word choice the same way autocorrect does spelling, it can dull language.

Though QuickType may not be able to capture certain qualities of language, it is sensitive to bias. On a brand-new iPhone, the suggestions for “you are a good…” are “friend,” “person,” “man.” Similarly, the suggestions for “Filipino...” are “food,” “people,” “girl.” The suggestions for “homosexuality is a...” are “sin,” “good,” “crime.” Like a child, QuickType has learned society’s biases. It then amplifies these biases through its suggestions.

Meanwhile, Google has upped the ante in the fight against typing. Released in 2015, Smart Reply can come up with entire responses to a variety of emails, from event plans to proclamations of love. If a friend wants to schedule a call, Smart Reply will come up with up to three diverse replies to choose from, such as “Sure, what time?” “Yeah, I’m down.” and “Sorry, I can’t.” The chat app Allo, released in 2016, can even use Smart Reply to respond to photos. Especially when on the go, there’s no question that choosing a Smart Reply suggestion is easier than typing. As of 2017, 12% of emails sent through Google’s Inbox email app were written by Smart Reply.

So far, Smart Reply is the pinnacle in AI’s evolving role in communication. Whereas spell check runs after typing, autocorrect runs during. QuickType acts before one types a word. Smart Reply steps in before one comes up with a response -- indeed, before they even see what they’re responding to.

With autocorrect and QuickType, the worries regard explicit effects on language. With Smart Reply, the worry is existential. For every step of the evolution of autocorrect, we gave some of our agency to an AI. With Smart Reply, our role remains nothing but confirming an AI’s work and sending it along. Is typing so hard that we need to replace ourselves with AI?

If your answer is no, there are many guides for disabling QuickType and Smart Reply.

The process described in this essay is not new. Technology has always effected language. In modern times, the printing press, the railroad, and the internet all had massively homogenizing effects on both spoken and written language. What’s new is the level of sophistication of the mediating technology. QuickType and Smart Reply would not have been possible without the computing power, state of research, and data availability of the 2010s. As the current golden age of AI research progresses, we will be able to give more and more of our agency to AI. In many cases, such as the more modest versions of autocorrect, the benefits will heavily outweigh the costs. In others, both researchers and users need to critically evaluate what it is they are even trying to accomplish.

There are two more text input methods not yet mentioned. First, there actually is a fast way to enter text on a touchscreen, available for both Androids and iPhones. Shape writing keyboards such as Nintype, Swype, SwiftKey, and Gboard allow one to enter text by sliding a finger around the keyboard instead of pecking individual letters. This method is not only fast, but highly tolerant to inaccuracy. It is easy for a new user to pick up, and scales with experience. 

Second, speech recognition is close approaching a state where one can confidently dictate text even in noisy environments. This would take getting used to, but because it’s so much more convenient -- people can speak up to 180 words per minute -- society will adjust. Yes, the golden future is a return to being driven nuts by one-sided conversations in restaurants. That doesn’t sound so bad compared to being churned into a pink racist goop of “Sure, sounds good!”
