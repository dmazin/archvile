We've awaited the age of artificial intelligence for decades. In our fantasies, AI is usually humanoid, straight out of the Jetsons. But while we anticipate the great arrival of the robotic butlers, AI has, in fact, already quietly permeated the fabric of our daily lives — from shopping, to driving, to communication.


The case in point is autocorrect. It’s so ubiquitous that you likely don't even realize how much it impacts your life. Without it, typing on a smartphone would be exceedingly difficult. That utility comes with a price, however, as autocorrect has begun to significantly alter our language.


Though you probably first encountered autocorrect as squiggly red lines under your spelling mistakes, its breakthrough came with the smartphone. As you mash the tiny keys on your phone's virtual keyboard, a sophisticated language model, working behind the scenes, determines which keys you actually intended to press. The iPhone, for example, invisibly enlarges keys you are likely to hit next, so they are harder to miss[1]. Naturally, spelling is automatically checked in the process. This hybrid of input assistance and spell checking is what we know as autocorrect.


Prior to autocorrect, spell check was constrained to word processors. Its impact was limited, effecting primarily formal documents like letters and essays. Now, thanks to autocorrect, which mediates everything typed on a smartphone — casual and formal speech included — spell check is essentially universal. While the Standard English spell check enforces may be preferable within the context of a formal document, this isn’t necessarily the case elsewhere. If you wish to to curse — or you actually prefer the spelling “miniscule,” — you have to fight with autocorrect.


Because actual humans adapt quickly to change (and even anticipate it), a human-edited dictionary like Merriam-Webster includes many words that autocorrect doesn’t, such as “abridgement.”


Autocorrect fundamentally alters English. Since there are many ways to spell most English sounds, its spelling has tends to drift. Autocorrect slows this evolution, enforcing Standard English in spaces where novel or informal spellings would have previously gone unmolested. Indeed, a 2011 study concluded that in a 20-year period prior to autocorrect's introduction, spell check was already largely responsible for an accelerating death of English words, while creation of new words heavily slowed, causing a actual shrinkage of the English lexicon[2].


Nevertheless, autocorrect undeniably provides a net benefit. Using our smart phones would simply be intractable without it. However, a new class of input assistant AIs works on a level beyond spelling, affecting the very way we choose our words. These AIs cross into dangerous territory, threatening to render our language into a pink goop.


In 2014, years after the iPhone’s release, typing on a smartphone apparently remained too slow[3]. With iOS 9, Apple launched a new product called QuickType, a small bar above the keyboard which automatically suggests the next word in a sentence, dramatically reducing the need for typing. “Typing as you know it might soon be a thing of the past,” Apple promised[4]. For simple phrases like “on my way,” QuickType works perfectly. Even for more complex phrases, its suggestions are often good enough.


But that seemingly unimportant difference between QuickType’s suggestion and the word you may have otherwise chosen is significant. The extensive dimensions of our language — for example, our meaning, mood, personality, bias — defy quantification by AI. If QuickType homogenizes our choice of words in the same way autocorrect does the way we spell them, we will become less expressive. Our language will be limited to the factors that a computer can detect and encode.


To see how QuickType interacts with our choice of words, consider the way QuickType picks up on bias. On a brand-new iPhone, the suggestions for “you are a good…” are “friend,” “person,” “man.” Similarly, the suggestions for “Filipino...” are “food,” “people,” “girl.” The suggestions for “homosexuality is a...” are “sin,” “good,” “crime.” Having learned our biases, QuickType amplifies their usage by suggesting them right back to us.

Meanwhile, Google has gone beyond words. Smart Reply, released in 2015, can come up with entire responses to a variety of emails, from event plans to proclamations of love. If a friend wants to schedule a call, Smart Reply will offer three diverse replies to choose from, such as “Sure, what time?” “Yeah, I’m down.”[a] and “Sorry, I can’t.” The chat app Allo, released in 2016, even uses Smart Reply to reply to photos -- for example, in response to a photo of a smiling friend: “You look so happy.” When on the go, Smart Reply’s suggestions are clearly more tempting than tiny virtual keys. As of 2017, 12% of emails sent through Google’s Inbox email app were written by Smart Reply[5].


  

Smart Reply’s responses, though often technically correct in meaning, are almost always markedly different from what we would have said on our own. Just like QuickType, Smart Reply homogenizes language.
  

Beyond that, using Smart Reply raises serious existential questions. Whereas autocorrect and QuickType function while you type, Smart Reply steps in before you come up with a response — indeed, before you even see what you’re responding to. All you need to do is choose a response and press send. In fact, like sitting in the driver’s seat of a self-driving car, your involvement is largely optional — the first suggestion is often correct (and will only improve as the AI learns), and Google certainly doesn’t need your help to press the send button. To put it bluntly, when you use Smart Reply, you are effectively voting to be automated away.



The existential concerns extend to the recipients of Smart Reply’s emails as well. Given Gmail’s popularity, you may have already received an email written by Smart Reply. Could you tell if you did? If tools like Smart Reply gain popularity, we will face a perversion of the Turing Test for which we didn’t volunteer. Increasingly, we will feel a nagging mystery whether we are interacting with a human or not.
  
![](/assets/autocorrect/spot.png){:class="spot-left"} The process described in this essay is not new. Technology has always exerted influence on language. The printing press, the railroad, and the internet all destroyed entire dialects and languages. What’s new is the level of sophistication of the mediating technology. QuickType and Smart Reply would not have been possible without the computing power, research advances, and the infinitudes of data available in the 21st century. More than ever, when AI researchers ask, “Can we?” the answer is “We can.”


We are learning how to bless AI with more and more agency. In many cases, this brings us great benefits. Using AI, we might achieve previously absurd goals. We could end alienating or dangerous labor, or significantly improve medicine. But we must be extremely careful.


Like all intellectual endeavors, AI research is driven by curiosity rather than necessity. More than ever, we must approach AI breakthroughs with skepticism. Not only does technology wield great power over us, it advances at an inhuman pace. Unless we anticipate the coming challenges, we will realize them only in hindsight.
